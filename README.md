HarlemDroid
===========

An useful Harlem Shake library for your boring app, made in few hours during the #droidcon #hackaton at #skillsmatter (ouch! no hastag support in github).

#### Purpose of this library:

Fun.

#### How to use:

Just import the project as your app project library.
In Eclipse (yes, we are still using Eclipse, for now) right click on your project and follow the "import" wizard.

### How to code:

When you want to shake your world, from any activity, just call

```java
Harlem.shake(this);
```

and thats'all.

#### And.. one more thing...

Try also the shocking version:

```java
Harlem.shock(this);
```
